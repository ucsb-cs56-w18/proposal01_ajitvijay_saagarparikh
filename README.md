# Project Description
The project that we would like to create would be an Android application, using Google Maps API, finds the distance it takes to walk from one class to another at UCSB.

# More Details about Project
As programmers we would use MongoDB or Firebase as a framework to assist us in creating this application as well as we will be using Android Studio. We are going off of the assumption that your schedule has been converted from a .html file to a JSON object. Using this JSON object along with Google Maps API, we are going to create a GUI that will have a map that has the distance and time that it takes to get from once location to another. 

# Issues
* Create a GUI
* Add animation to our Map
* Determine a way to use Google API
* Utilizing Firebase or MongoDB
